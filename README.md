# Just a game browser

built on [Electron with modified](https://github.com/c0re100/electron) and [electron-browser-shell](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell).

## What is this?

The successor of [Project IMYS](https://github.com/c0re100/imys)

It's designed to play DMM web games without pain.

That means no more background throttling on this browser, even if you switch to another game tab or minimize to the taskbar, the game will still run fine in the background.

So you no longer need to change chrome/firefox settings to avoid background throttling ANYMORE!

### Wait?! Why not call __DMM GAMES Browser__?

Because it's not just for DMM games, any game that uses the Unity web framework is ok too.

That's why it's called __Just a game browser__.
